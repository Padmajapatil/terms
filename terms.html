 <h3>
  FEES AND PAYMENT
 </h3>
 <br>
 <p>
  1. All fees for Visa Service Desk services are shown on the website, including any indirect taxes applicable 
  to the fees, and any other charges or fees charged by an issuing authority, Visa Application Centre, or any
  courier or delivery service. <br> <br>
  2. From the moment that Visa Service Desk submits an application for a travel document to the issuing
  authority on behalf of the Client, the costs of the services provided by Visa Service Desk to the Client can no
  longer be reclaimed from Visa Service Desk. <br> <br>
  3. Consular fees and availability of services are subject to change without notice. Costs and services can
  change between the time that the order has been placed and the time that the order has been completed.
  Visa Service Desk strives to pass on the aforementioned changes to the Client as soon as possible. <br> <br>
  4. Visa Service Desk reserves the right to select the most suitable service due to the time constraints
  indicated by the Client. <br> <br>
   All fees paid by Visa Service Desk to an issuing authority on behalf of the Client are non-refundable. In
  the event that a visa, passport or other document application is submitted on behalf of the Client and the
  request is rejected for whatever reason, Visa Service Desk will, at the request of the Client, make an extra
  attempt to obtain the travel document. The Client is obliged to pay any additional costs determined by the
  issuing authority and if the extra attempt is required due to an error made by the Client in their application,
  Visa Service Desk is entitled to charge the relevant handling fees, as shown on the website, for this extra
  attempt. <br> <br>
  6. For orders that are not submitted through the online order process, additional service fees may be
charged. This is not the case if the Visa Service Desk paid telephone number is used for the placement of
the order.<br> <br>
7. Visa Service Desk is authorised to retain passports and documents until full payment has been received.<br> <br>
8. Visa Service Desk service fees may vary based on the number of business days available to provide the
service. Closing days and holidays of the consulate are excluded. <br> <br>
9. If an application is rejected or refused, the fees paid are not refundable and Visa Service Desk retains
the right to retain the agreed handling fees.<br> <br>
10. For orders cancelled prior to submission of the application at the relevant Embassy or Consulate, the
Client will only be charged a cancellation fee and any courier or delivery costs as stated on the Visa Service
Desk website. <br> <br>
11. Once the application has been submitted to the appropriate authority, the full costs for this are due.
Additional cancellation fees may apply to a withdrawal of the application. <br> <br>
12. Payment of the invoices of Visa Service Desk and all other fees owed by the Client to Visa Service Desk
must be completed in full within 14 days from the date of the invoice, and before the passport, visa and/or
legalisation is returned to the Client, unless otherwise agreed in writing as part of a company service
contract. The Client is not entitled to suspension of any payment or to initiate any claims against Visa
Service Desk. The initially chosen services must be paid in advance. In the case of additional services or
products being chosen or used, a final invoice will be issued which needs to be paid before the travel
document(s) are returned to the Client. <br> <br>
13. If the Client is more than one (legal) person, the Client is jointly and severally liable to Visa Service
Desk for all obligations arising from this agreement.
